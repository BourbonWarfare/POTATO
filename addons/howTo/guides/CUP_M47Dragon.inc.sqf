----------------------------------<br/>
- The missile does not have a continually burning engine, rather a series of propulsion charges that explode to keep the missile aloft. Each boosting charge will throw the missile towards the aiming reticle.<br/>
- The Dragon manual recommends holding your breath to steady your aim the entire flight time, but do your best to make sure you keep your crosshairs on taraget.<br/>
- It can be hard to handle sudden changes in lateral target velocity, aiming where you believe the target will be when the missile would hit can help mitigate these effects."}]]
