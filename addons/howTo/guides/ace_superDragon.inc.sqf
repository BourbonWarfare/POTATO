- Once the optic is attached to the launcher, it is ready to use.<br/>
- After the launcher is spent, ACE Interact with the launcher and detach the SU-36/P Day Sight.<br/><br/>
<font  color=""#FFA700"">Aiming and Guidance Notes:</font color><br/>
----------------------------------<br/>
- The missile does not have a continually burning engine, rather a series of propulsion charges that explode to keep the missile aloft. Each boosting charge will throw the missile towards the aiming reticle.<br/>
- It can be hard to handle sudden changes in lateral target velocity, aiming where you believe the target will be when the missile would hit can help mitigate these effects."}]]
